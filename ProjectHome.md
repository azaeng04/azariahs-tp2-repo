# Live Product Feed System #
This is a system that keeps track of items in a store and notifies registered customers who have activated notifications on a particular product

The system shows a live feed on a particular product a customer activated notifications for.
It notifies on product specials and wasted products. As well as the product status on whether it is unavailable and when it will be available again in a store.

This system will relieve the task of a customer from going into a store and finding out whether a particular item exists in the store, is available, wasted or on special.
